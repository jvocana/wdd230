            <p>
                Our founder Joe Carlson started with just a truck and a dream. He would drive around everywhere around Carlsbad California
                looking for interested customers. Being mobile was important because our presence could be felt a lot more. Just like the 
                local Ice cream truck Joe pushed forward through every neighborhood.

                Bountiful foods started with a dream. To provide healthy organic fruit based foods for everyone. We also wanted 
                to be able to provide people iwth information about what they are eating. That includes the nutrition facts and even who 
                grew that fruit. We think this provides better transparency, so we can build trust with our customers.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Today Bountiful foods consists of four food trucks and a physical location in Carlsbad California.
                We look forward to expanding more and more so we can provide tasty drinks for all!
